# First-Repo-Experiment

The following highlights what I learnt from this project: 
1. A shebang is a character sequence consisting of the characters #! followed by the path to an interpreter. It is used in script files to indicate which interpreter should be used to run the script. The shebang is placed at the very beginning of the script file.

2. A README.md file is a crucial component of many software projects, especially those hosted on platforms like GitHub. Its primary functions include:
 a. Project description and key feature highlights
 b. Documentation and Support
 c. Installation steps and Usage

3. The purpose of a .gitignore file is to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git when committing changes to a repository. This helps to keep the repository clean and avoid committing unnecessary files, such as temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information.

4. Using virtual environments is a best practice in Python development to ensure that your projects are isolated, manageable, and reproducible. A virtual environment allows you to create an isolated environment for your Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has. By using a virtual environment, you can ensure that your project uses the exact versions of packages it needs.
